## About
My passion for software development stems from the incredible freedom and creativity it offers. After discovering programming in high school. I was immediately hooked. Following an engineering path in University exposed me to a wide range of hardware and software topics. These subjects aided me in appreciating the interdisciplinary nature as a whole. After working in an engineering field, I realized that my true passion lay in software development, and making the decision to transition into a career more focused on development, has been the best decision I've ever made.
