## Signa Learning Management system
From 2019, I was responsible the for management, development and scoping of new business requirements, for one of our clients (Signa Academy), a learning institution, aiming to up-skill the unemployed youth enabling them to be better equipped with the hand-on skill to attract better employment opportunities and/or create new opportunities for themselves. This project is a muliti-tenant learning management system, built with the purpose of centralizing the information of the students accomodated.

## B1Link/iSuppli
B1SA is a company which offers supply chain management solutions and transformation services for small to large businesses, they provide a platform for companies to network, and develop business relationships with one another one of the key product they provide is BBEEE and Regulatory compliance checks for companies registered on their site as well for their clients' supply chain, which is of extreme importance in South Africa ( because of the BBEEE regulations). Some of their large clients are Toyota, Sun International, GoldFields, and TFG. Coming from a legacy system built using some old tech and architecture. B1SA were looking to re-innovate their system and maintain their lead/advantage in their market. We have therefore been tasked with implementing these new changes.

## Dicilicious
I created a webpage to promote my friend's food business, which was a great opportunity for me to experiment with Next.js. During the process, I also learned how to purchase domain names, obtain SSL certificates, and host a single page application (SPA)

## BL DC Propeller Angle Stabilizer
During my 3rd year of university, I worked with a team on a project that introduced us to control system principles, specifically PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers. Our project involved constructing a sea-saw structure with a Brush-less DC motor and propeller mounted on one end, with the objective of maintaining a specified angle between the sea-saw and the supporting middle beam by controlling the thrust generated by the propellers. The project consisted of three main sections, including the mechanical structure of the sea-saw and beam, the electronic motor driving circuits, and the embedded control logic for the motor. As part of the project team, I was responsible for programming the micro-controller (STM32f49) that controlled the motor, including the development of the control logic to ensure that the motor generated the appropriate thrust to maintain the desired angle. Undertaking this project during my 3rd year of university provided me with valuable experience applying theoretical control system concepts in a practical setting. Working in a team allowed me to develop communication and collaboration skills while tackling a complex engineering challenge. I believe that this project helped me further my understanding of engineering principles and prepared me for future projects and a career in engineering or related fields.
